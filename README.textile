h1. Indie - A Neo4j Unmanaged Extension SDK

"Unmanaged Extensions":http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/server-unmanaged-extensions.html provide a way to extend the capabilities of the Neo4j server with the full power of the JDK.

A few use cases for Unmanaged Extensions include: 
* Customizing the RESTful interface
* Extending the library of Neo4j's "built-in graph algorithms":http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api-graph-algos.html 
* Integrating Neo4j with other database or messaging systems
* Maximizing performance of server-side operations
* Programming graph algorithms in other JVM languages such as Clojure, Scala, and Groovy

In short, if it can run on the JDK, it can run as an Unmanaged Extension. Indie establishes some useful conventions for Unmanaged Extension development by providing:

* Examples of some common use cases
* An application architecture that separates JAX-RS from graph algorithm concerns
* Automatic transaction management for web client requests using the com.sun.jersey.spi.ClosableService interface
* Unit and functional tests
* An Ant build script automating testing and distribution
* An embedded Gremlin console for easy database maintenance when the server is down


h2. Getting Started

Indie comes bundled with a 'ping' extension that will let you ensure that your Unmanaged Extension is working correctly.

* Download the latest "Neo4j release":http://neo4j.org/download and unpack into the neo4j-server directory.

* Update neo4j*.properties files in conf directories
* conf/neo4j-server.properties
** set org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes
org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=com.aurelius.indie.resources=/ext

* uncomment org.neo4j.server.webserver.address=0.0.0.0 to allow connections from other than localhost

* update the server-dir property in build/dist.xml to the new neo4j version

* update com.aurelius.indie.test.functional.Server.java with the new neo4j directory location

* bin/build-and-run.sh

* stop the server with

  dist/neo4j*/bin/neo4j stop


h2. Deployment

```text
ant dist
cd dist
tar -zxvf indie.tar.gz
neo4j*/bin/neo4j start
