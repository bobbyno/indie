h1. Indie - A Neo4j Unmanaged Extension SDK

"Unmanaged Extensions":http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/server-unmanaged-extensions.html provide a way to extend the capabilities of the Neo4j server with the full power of the JDK.

A few use cases for Unmanaged Extensions include: 
* Customizing Neo4j's default RESTful interface
* Extending the library of Neo4j's "built-in graph algorithms":http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api-graph-algos.html 
* Integrating Neo4j with other database or messaging systems
* Maximizing performance of server-side operations
* Programming graph algorithms in other JVM languages such as Clojure, Scala, and Groovy

Indie establishes some useful conventions for Unmanaged Extension development by providing:

* Examples of some common use cases
* An application architecture that separates web request and graph algorithm concerns
* Automatic transaction management using the com.sun.jersey.spi.ClosableService interface
* A unit and functional test framework that cleans up the database after each test
* An Ant build script automating testing and distribution
* An embedded Gremlin console for ease of offline database maintenance

Indie has been tested with the Community, Advanced, and Enterprise editions of Neo4j 1.6.1.

h2. Getting Started

Indie comes bundled with a 'ping' extension that will let you ensure that your Unmanaged Extension is working correctly.

* Download the latest "Neo4j release":http://neo4j.org/download and unpack into the neo4j-server directory.

* Update neo4j*.properties files in conf directories
* conf/neo4j-server.properties
** set org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes
org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=com.aurelius.indie.resources=/ext

* uncomment org.neo4j.server.webserver.address=0.0.0.0 to allow connections from other than localhost

* update the server-dir property in build/dist.xml to the new neo4j version

* update com.aurelius.indie.test.functional.Server.java with the new neo4j directory location

* bin/build-and-run.sh

* stop the server with

  dist/neo4j*/bin/neo4j stop


h2. Deployment

```text
ant dist
cd dist
tar -zxvf indie.tar.gz
neo4j*/bin/neo4j start
open http://localhost:7474
```

h2. Where to Learn More

If you're new to graph databases, "Getting started with Gremlin":http://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Getting-Started will help you quickly get up and running with a REPL. Gremlin supports Neo4j out of the box, and the examples in Indie use Gremlin extensively.

For comprehensive documentation about Neo4j, see the "Neo4j Manual":http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/index.html.
